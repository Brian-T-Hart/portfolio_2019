		description: 'Thanks for checking out WCHS-Lifecalling. I had a lot of fun working on this React app that I made for a high school Life Calling class. The app allows students to record and track information regarding their personality and strengths as they take various tests throughout the year. After each test, the students select values from a list and the data is quickly populated to the screen and stored in a MySQL database for future retrieval. The app also allows for the upload of three documents in pdf, jpeg, or png format. The site was constructed using a MySQL database, Express, React on the front end, Node.js, and Cloudinary for document management.',
